# CSW223: Programming for Interactive Media
A repository containing multiple small projects created in my third web design class (CSW 223: Programming for Interactive Media) at the University of Mount Union taught by Dr. James Klayder.

Some code is supplied by Dr. James Klayder and modified by Alec Barker.

It contains webpages that use Javascript and canvases to create the following:

- Changing the Color of an Object
- Changing the Position of an Object
- Changing Text
- Reading Input from a Textbox
- An Addition Calculator
- Tracking Mouse Movement
- Responding to Clicks on Objects
- Dragging an Object Across a Canvas
- Drawing New Objects with a Button or Textbox Input
- Altering a Drawing
- Randomly Changing Colors
